Here are some notes from my research and convo with an AI about this project. use this as a basis for the builds we complete. We're going to follow this step by step to build out an MVP

Yes, it is. Here is a tight MVP plan based on your constraints.

MVP scope
	•	Private workspace per user. Shared right rail: chat and group image stream.
	•	Image gen via Gemini 2.5 Flash on Vertex. Expose only size. Always create 4 images per prompt.
	•	Roles: host, collaborator, viewer. Host is the only camera broadcaster.
	•	Persist prompts and params, images, chat, optional session recording.
	•	Sessions have random link. Each role has its own access code.
	•	Vanilla front end. Backend on Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects. File storage on R2. LiveKit for A/V and data.

High level architecture
	•	Cloudflare Worker gateway
	•	Issues LiveKit tokens and role-scoped room permissions.
	•	Authenticates join by session link + access code.
	•	Calls Vertex for image gen.
	•	Signs R2 upload URLs for thumbnails if needed.
	•	Durable Object: SessionDO
	•	Tracks participants, roles, presence, chat, shared image stream, and per-session limits.
	•	Emits realtime events to clients via LiveKit data channel or WebSocket.
	•	R2 buckets
	•	originals, thumbs, recordings. Object metadata stores owner, session, prompt hash, size.
	•	Analytics
	•	Workers Analytics Engine for server events. Simple client pings for UI funnels.

Minimal data model
	•	Session: id, createdAt, hostId, livekitRoom, accessCodes per role, settings (model, size, imagesPerPrompt=4, hostBroadcast=true), sharedStream list of imageIds.
	•	Participant: id, sessionId, role, displayName, joinedAt, lastSeen.
	•	Generation: id, sessionId, ownerId, prompt, size, model, status, output imageIds, timings, safety flags.
	•	Image: id, sessionId, ownerId, r2KeyOriginal, r2KeyThumb, width, height, bytes, createdAt, shared boolean.
	•	ChatMessage: id, sessionId, senderId, role, text, timestamp, type (text, system, share, moderation).
	•	AnalyticsEvent: eventName, sessionId, participantId, ts, properties.

API outline
	•	POST /sessions.create → returns session id, invite link, codes by role.
	•	POST /sessions.join → body: session id, access code. Returns app token + LiveKit token + role.
	•	GET /sessions/:id/stream → websocket for chat and stream events if you do not piggyback on LiveKit data.
	•	POST /generate → body: prompt, size. Creates Generation, calls Vertex, uploads 4 images to R2, returns image ids.
	•	POST /images/:id/favorite → flips shared=true and pushes into shared stream.
	•	POST /chat → body: text. Broadcasts to all.
	•	POST /moderation/remove → body: {imageId|messageId}. Host only.
	•	GET /me/library → paged list of my images and gens.

LiveKit plan
	•	Room per session. Host is publisher for video and audio. Others subscribe only.
	•	Enable data channel for chat and lightweight presence. If simpler, keep chat on Worker websockets and use LiveKit only for A/V.
	•	Optional server recording toggle stored on Session.

Front end slices
	•	Canvas: 1-4 viewer slots, my “Your Images” column, star to add to shared stream.
	•	Prompt bar: text box, size selector, submit, generating state.
	•	Right rail: participants, shared image stream grid, chat.
	•	Join screen: enter display name and access code.

Storage layout in R2
	•	originals/sessionId/ownerId/imageId.webp
	•	thumbs/sessionId/ownerId/imageId_512.webp
	•	recordings/sessionId/date/asset
	•	Use object metadata for prompt hash, model, size, safety.

Moderation and limits
	•	Vertex safety on. Host can remove shared images or chat messages.
	•	Rate limits per participant and per session in SessionDO.
	•	Simple abuse caps: images per minute and total bytes per session.

Analytics events
	•	session_created, joined, generate_requested, generate_completed, image_favorited, chat_sent, moderation_remove, recording_started, recording_stopped, leave.
	•	Add basic funnel dashboards: join success rate, gen latency, share rate.

Build order
	1.	Session create and join with codes + LiveKit host-only broadcast.
	2.	Chat in right rail.
	3.	Prompt → Vertex → store to R2 → show in “Your Images.”
	4.	Favorite to push into shared stream.
	5.	Thumbs, loading and error states.
	6.	Basic moderation and rate limits.
	7.	Analytics wiring.
	8.	Optional recording toggle.

Acceptance criteria
	•	Two browsers in one session: each has private canvases.
	•	Host video visible to all. Others cannot publish video.
	•	Each user can generate 4 images and see them privately.
	•	Favoriting pushes an image into the shared stream for everyone.
	•	Chat works and persists.
	•	Refreshing the page restores session state for the last hour.



Details



Got it. Here is the expanded build plan, step by step, with the smallest viable slice for each.

1) Session create and join with codes + LiveKit host-only broadcast

Goal
Create a session link, gate entry by role code, join the LiveKit room with host-only publishing.

Backend
	•	Worker route: POST /sessions.create → returns {sessionId, inviteUrl, codes: {host, collaborator, viewer}}.
	•	Durable Object SessionDO
	•	State: sessionId, settings {model, size, perPrompt=4, hostBroadcast=true}, codes (store salted hash), participants, presence.
	•	POST /sessions.join with {sessionId, code, name}
	•	Validate code → assign role.
	•	Mint LiveKit access token with publish permissions only for host. Others subscribe-only.
	•	Return {role, lkToken, sessionSnapshot}.
	•	Secrets and setup: CF env for LiveKit keys, Vertex SA creds, R2 bucket names.

Frontend
	•	Join screen: name + access code.
	•	Room shell: video tile area pinned to host, right rail scaffold, private canvas scaffold.

Acceptance
	•	Host can publish AV. Others cannot.
	•	Reload restores role and presence.

2) Chat in right rail

Goal
Shared chat for the session with persistence.

Backend
	•	Use LiveKit data channel for realtime.
	•	SessionDO persists messages and serves last N on join.
	•	POST /chat to allow server-side injection of system messages.

Frontend
	•	Chat list with timestamps, sender, scrollback to last 100.
	•	Input with send and typing indicator.
	•	Offline replay from sessionSnapshot.

Acceptance
	•	Two clients see each message within the session. Refresh shows history.

3) Prompt → Vertex → store to R2 → show in Your Images

Goal
Personal generation pipeline that returns 4 images and stores everything.

Backend
	•	POST /generate with {prompt, size}.
	•	Create Generation record in SessionDO {id, ownerId, prompt, size, status=pending}.
	•	Call Vertex Images (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for 4 outputs.
	•	Upload to R2 originals/ and thumbs/ with metadata {sessionId, ownerId, generationId, variantIndex, model, size, prompt_hash}.
	•	Update Generation → completed with imageIds and timings.
	•	Emit progress events over data channel.

Frontend
	•	Prompt bar with size select and Submit.
	•	Local “Your Images” column.
	•	Show 4 items as they complete, not only at the end.

Acceptance
	•	Each user’s images stay private until favorited.
	•	Hardcoded count is 4 per submit.

4) Favorite to push into shared stream

Goal
One click to share a private image to the session stream.

Backend
	•	POST /images/:id/favorite → verifies ownership → marks shared=true.
	•	SessionDO appends imageId to sharedStream queue and broadcasts.

Frontend
	•	Star button on each of My Images.
	•	Right rail Image Stream updates in near real time.
	•	Duplicate guard if already shared.

Acceptance
	•	Everyone sees the shared image appear in the stream with owner tag.

5) Thumbs, loading, and error states

Goal
Fast UI and clear failure modes.

Backend
	•	Serve thumbs via Cloudflare Image Resizing on top of R2 or precompute 512px thumbs at upload.
	•	Standard error shapes: {code, message, retryAfter}. Map Vertex safety blocks and quota errors.

Frontend
	•	Skeletons while pending. Per-image spinners.
	•	Badges: “blocked by safety,” “retry available,” “rate limited.”
	•	Retry for individual variants.

Acceptance
	•	No layout shifts. Errors are actionable and do not break the session.

6) Basic moderation and rate limits

Goal
Give host light control and protect the service.

Backend
	•	Host-only endpoints: POST /moderation/remove {imageId|messageId}.
	•	Vertex safety on.
	•	SessionDO counters for rate limits
	•	per participant: prompts per minute, images per hour
	•	per session: total images cap
	•	Simple keyword filter on chat as a first pass.

Frontend
	•	Host sees remove on stream items and chat rows.
	•	Clear toast: removed by host.

Acceptance
	•	Non-host cannot remove. Rate limits return friendly errors.

7) Analytics wiring

Goal
Measure funnel and latency with minimal footprint.

Backend
	•	Workers Analytics Engine events server side: session_created, join_ok, gen_request, gen_complete, favorite, moderation, leave.
	•	Log timings: TTFB to first image and total time to 4.
	•	Optional CF Logs to R2 for raw events.

Frontend
	•	sendBeacon for client-only events like UI view and prompt_submit_clicked.

Acceptance
	•	Dashboard queries show join rate, gen success rate, average latency, share rate.

8) Optional recording toggle

Goal
Host can record the call, save to R2.

Backend
	•	LiveKit egress start/stop API behind POST /recordings with host auth.
	•	Store outputs to R2 recordings/sessionId/… with metadata.
	•	Emit system messages when recording starts and stops.

Frontend
	•	Host-only toggle with red indicator.
	•	Recording badge visible to all.

Acceptance
	•	Starting creates an asset in R2. Stopping finalizes. Users see status update.

⸻

Small cross-cutting notes
	•	Use one DO per session to keep state and coordinate events.
	•	Store prompts only in Generations, never in R2 metadata.
	•	Access codes are per role and stored as salted hashes.
	•	Tokens to clients are short lived. Refresh via /sessions.join on reconnect.
	•	Keep everything behind feature flags so each step can ship independently.
